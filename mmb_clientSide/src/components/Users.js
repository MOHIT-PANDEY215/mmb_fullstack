        "mentalProblem" : "I was trapped in the FOMO of CDC and sometimes got into panic attacks. Things seemed to be uncertain during the summer vacation. Seeing my friends working hard behind it, I became more nervous. Even after my internship was sorted off-campus, I used to feel uneasy seeing students cracking big companies.",
        "mentalSolution": "I used to spend time alone in the roof of my hall, and listened to music. That was accompanied with self-talk and affirmations that things will be okay soon, and I will become stronger." ,
        "careerProblem" : "During my summers, I was in a dilemma of which career path to choose. I had learnt web development for internships, and gave coding contests which fetched me good ranks. But as the CDC season arrived, I started losing confidence and my rank started decreasing. I had then started considering strategy and consulting roles.",
        "careerSolution" : "I took some time to think about a career change, but once I was determined, I did not look back. I did a few internships in strategy role and started building my new profile. I changed my path from CDC to off-campus, and ultimately sorted out my upcoming summers in a great company with a good package.",

        "mentalProblem" : "In summers I worked very hard to learn to code and CP and all. I spent days and nights, and solved hundred of problems. Despite all those, I couldn't see my name shortlisted in any company for days. I started believing that I am not fit for the profile or competition in KGP. Self Doubt on my capabilities started growing inside me. People with malpractices got selected- I used to feel very sad when non-deserving candidates doing malpractice got selected.",
        "mentalSolution": "I kept on solving problems and tried to keep myself occupied all the time. I kept convincing myself that even if I don't get selected I will do a project during my summers. I persuaded myself to keep on coding so that after 1 year (in placements) I will be an awesome coder. I always used to keep myself occupied and motivated that placement is there to help me out anyways. I kept myself busy doing others things like learning new skills, applying off-campus to all job posts in all firms and LinkedIn.",
        "careerProblem" : "I didn't know that there is so much competition in KGP. To be honest, everyone is coding in KGP and this increases the competition. Months before CDC, I didn't do anything else other than CP. I also rejected some internship offers and other activities so that I could prepare well for CDC during my semester and summers as well. But this was not at all necessary. Extra activities and intern would have helped me build my resume better. I would have rather mastered the art of time management than running away from them.",
        "careerSolution" : "I applied in a lot of off-campus job portals, linkedin, and what not. I recreated my cv, gave contests to increase my ratings, and added interesting project in my resume. The best thing I did was that I kept on solving problems everyday. My friends who got the offers used to motivate me to keep doing CP and that helped me a lot keeping me busy during the go.",
        "roadmap" : "During the semester before CDC, I did moderate CP and participated in tech hackathons(Tech GC if in kgp). Added to that, I did a good self project and searched for summer internship under any prof or in a startup. \n During summers, I did hardcore coding (5-6 hrs daily) If you are doing an internship during this phase, learn to manage your time properly.\n During the CDC internship drive, I solved the PYQs of companies, SDE sheet and did revision.",

        "mentalProblem" : "One of the most haunting things I experienced in my life was Day 1 of CDC where I was rejected by two companies in which I was shortlisted in Day 1. I was not able to crack the interviews. I was good in the first interview but the question they gave was to be solved in a more efficient way than I did. Due to it I was rejected. The  next went bad because my confidence was dead due to the first. But this shouldn't happen.",
        "mentalSolution": "I talked to my parents as they are my support system. They cheered me up and motivated me for Day 2. I shared with them the whole interview thing, and they just said 'Be confident with your body language and emotions', and their advice worked. I cracked JLR on Day 2. Also I'm a Bhakt of God so I listened some Bhakti songs and read Sunderkaand once. You should be motivated even after the rejections.",
        "careerProblem" : "In my preparation, there were no problems. However, on my first interview od Day 1, a question was to be solved in th best of O(1) time complexity, while I solved in O(log n) and got rejected.",
        "careerSolution" : " Try to give the best answer in interview and get some hints from the interviewer. Along with that, revise your concepts before the interview, and look confident during the interview.",
        "roadmap" : "I just kept doing CP with proper concentration. You shouldn't focus on many things and end up losing everything but should focus on one particular thing at a time.",

        "mentalSolution": "When I got the offer all the anxiety subsided eventually. During the process, talking to seniors and friends helped me gain confidence and guidance on how to go about things. Personally, I kept my expectations as low as possible so that later I wouldn't be disheartened. I realized that I just need to give my best. What happens after that really doesn't matter. It is all cause and effect.",
        "careerProblem" : "Career confusion definitely bugged me a lot. Specifically not knowing the opportunities and lifestyle I would lead after choosing a particular career path. Seniors are always there to help and give guidance, so approaching them would be a very good choice.",
        "careerSolution" : "Talking to my batchmates was the most beneficial thing that I did which helped me get a clear picture of what I really wanted to do and the companies I would like to apply for. I also thought about the life I want to lead and the things I want to do later in life and which career path would better help me pursue those. Finally after I got the offer I was happy that I would get an opportunity to rock in the domain of my choice.",
        "roadmap" : "I was into core Mechanical Engineering and did a few projects which helped me a lot to bag the internship. Also I studied my core subjects well which helped me clear the technical round. The GD round was all about clarity of thought and presence of mind which fortunately i did well in.",
